# Midterm Contribution: Feature Importance with XGBoost

This folder contains my individual contribution to the midterm project.

## What I Worked On

- Data preprocessing and pruning for extreme class imbalance
- Training an XGBoost classifier to assess feature importance
- Identifying and removing uninformative features to improve downstream modeling

## Files

- xgboost_feature_importance.ipynb:
  Trains an XGBoost classifier and analyzes feature importance to guide feature removal decisions.

## Notes

Other models such as logistic regression were implemented by other group members and are not included here.
